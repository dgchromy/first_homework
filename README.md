# first_homework
Good first homework!!!
made it so the search media link work like the others did. 
so what i did was that i wen it and changed all of the "divs" to what i felt was the right semantic. 
Sleaned up the class's so it was easier to read the html file.
Spaced out html so it was easier to read and see errors i made or that where there at the begining. 
re organized the css so that it made sense looking at the html and css side bide side. 
I got rid of css "functions" that didnt make sense to have on there. 
Created new css "functions" so that the one function worked for multiple tags in the html. 

im not sure if if Functions is the correct word for css.
